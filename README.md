## Internship Assignment - Igniters Hub
### Overview
This repository contains solutions to the Internship Assignment Challenges provided by Igniters Hub. Each challenge is implemented in Python and follows the given specifications.

### Challenges & Solutions
### Challenge 1 – Evaluate Arithmetic Expressions
A Python program that reads arithmetic expressions from an input file, evaluates them, and writes the results to an output file.

Allowed Operators: +, -, *, /, ^, (), [], {}

Input Example:

10 - 2 =

100 * ( 2 + 12 ) =

(10 + 5^2) ( (5*-2) + 9 - 3^3) / 2 =

Output Example:
10 - 2 = 8

100 * ( 2 + 12 ) = 1400

(10 + 5^2) ( (5*-2) + 9 - 3^3) / 2 = -490

### Challenge 2 – Send an Email
A Python script that sends an email to hr@ignitershub.com with:

Subject: "Challenge 3 Completed"

Body: Includes name, semester, branch, and roll number.

Attachment: A PNG, JPG, or JPEG image.

### Challenge 3 – Palindrome Checker
A Python program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome.

Input Example:
Enter a string: racecar

Output Example:
The string 'racecar' is a palindrome.

### Challenge 4 – String Manipulation
A Python program that processes a sentence with the following operations:

Count the number of words.
Reverse the order of words.
Replace spaces with hyphens (-).
Input Example:
Enter a sentence: The quick brown fox

Output Example:
Number of words: 4
Reversed sentence: fox brown quick The
Modified sentence: The-quick-brown-fox
